# The-Fool-Game


This project aims to develop a computer vision system that can recognize and identify playing cards placed on a table. 
The system utilizes Python and the OpenCV library to process and analyze images from a screen. 
After card recognition, ability to play cards with a person using a machine learning-based algorithm will be add. 

The project will be divided into two stages:

1. Card and Event Recognition
2. Full-fledged Human-Player Game
